hdfs dfs -get -p hdfs_commands/data.txt data.txt

--that might be appear get: chown: invalid group: ‘root:supergroup’

4. Now create a file in local directory named data_local.txt and move this file to hdfs in hdfs_commands directory.

touch data_local.txt
hdfs dfs -moveFromLocal data_local.txt hdfs_commands
--ask to move not copy


5. Create a file data_hdfs.txt in hdfs_commands directory and copy it to local file system.

hdfs dfs -touchz hdfs_commands/data_hdfs.txt 
hdfs dfs -get hdfs_commands/data_hdfs.txt

6. Create a file in local filesystem named file1.txt and put it to hdfs
